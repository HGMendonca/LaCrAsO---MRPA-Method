# LaCrAsO---MRPA-Method
We apply the Matrix Random Phase Approximation to study superconductivity in LaCrAsO.

This project is separated into five main processes: 

1 - Calculation of the chemical potential (Chempot Directory); 

2 - Calculation of the Fermi Surface (FS Directory); 

3 - Calculation of non-interacting susceptibility (Non-Interacting Directory); 

4 - Calculation of interacting susceptibility (Interacting Directory); 

5 - Calculation of the gap function and pairing strength (Gamma Directory).
